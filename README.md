Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how ChatGPT can be effectively used to enhance code quality through debugging, error handling, and documentation across multiple programming scenarios. The tasks simulate real-world issues developers face and show how AI can assist in identifying bugs, improving robustness, and documenting code clearly.

All exercises focus on critical software development skills such as logical debugging, user input validation, game state handling, and clean documentation.

🎯 Objectives

Use ChatGPT to identify and fix logical and runtime errors

Improve program stability using proper error handling

Validate all user inputs to prevent crashes

Add professional documentation to Python code

Demonstrate AI-assisted problem solving in real-world coding scenarios

🧪 Tasks Overview

1️⃣ Debugging – Python Factorial (Iterative)

Issue: Infinite loop caused by a missing update of the loop variable.

Fix Applied:

Decremented the loop counter to ensure proper termination.

Outcome:

Correct factorial calculation

Program terminates as expected

2️⃣ Debugging – Python Arguments

Issue: Script printed the Python file name along with arguments.

Fix Applied:

Started iteration from sys.argv[1] instead of sys.argv[0].

Outcome:

Only user-provided arguments are printed

3️⃣ Debugging – HTML / JavaScript

Issue: Button click event did not work due to mismatched element ID.

Fix Applied:

Corrected the typo in the button id to match JavaScript selector.

Outcome:

Background color changes successfully on button click

4️⃣ Debugging – Python Minesweeper

Issue: Game lacked a win condition and could not detect successful completion.

Fix Applied:

Implemented a win-detection mechanism by tracking revealed cells

Added logic to end the game when all non-mine cells are revealed

Outcome:

Game correctly identifies win and loss states

5️⃣ Documentation – Python Recursive Factorial

Task: Add clear and structured documentation.

Solution:

Added Python docstrings with three sections:

Function description

Parameters

Returns

Outcome:

Code is now self-documented and easier to understand

6️⃣ Error Handling – Python Checkbook

Issue: Program crashed on non-numeric input.

Fix Applied:

Added try / except blocks to handle invalid user input

Displayed user-friendly error messages

Outcome:

Program no longer crashes

Improved user experience and robustness

7️⃣ Debugging – Tic Tac Toe (Python)

Issues Identified:

Incorrect winner display

No input validation

No draw condition

Fixes Applied:

Corrected winner logic

Added input validation for range and type

Implemented draw detection

Outcome:

Fully functional game with win, lose, and draw states

🤖 Role of ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used throughout this project to:

Analyze faulty program behavior

Identify logical and runtime errors

Propose efficient and clean fixes

Improve program structure and reliability

Add professional documentation

This demonstrates how AI can serve as a powerful assistant in modern software development workflows.

🏁 Conclusion

Through this project, we successfully applied AI-assisted debugging, error handling, and documentation techniques across multiple programming tasks. The result is a collection of robust, well-documented, and user-safe programs that reflect best practices in software development.

This approach highlights the practical value of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT into everyday coding activities to produce smarter, faster, and more reliable code.
